/**
 * Two Sum (Easy)
 *
 * Your finance team needs to find which two invoices from a list add up
 * to a specific budget allocation. Given an array of invoice amounts and
 * a target budget, return the indices of the two invoices that sum to
 * the target.
 *
 * Pattern: Hash Map — complement lookup, O(n) time
 *
 * @param {number[]} nums - array of amounts
 * @param {number} target - target sum
 * @returns {number[]} indices [i, j] where nums[i] + nums[j] === target, or []
 */
