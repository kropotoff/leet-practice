/**
 * Find Median from Data Stream (Hard)
 *
 * A real-time analytics dashboard must report the median value of a
 * continuously arriving data stream at any point. Implement a class
 * with addNum(num) and findMedian() methods.
 *
 * Pattern: Two heaps — max-heap for the lower half, min-heap for the
 * upper half. addNum is O(log n), findMedian is O(1).
 *
 * Hint: You'll need to implement or import MaxHeap and MinHeap helpers.
