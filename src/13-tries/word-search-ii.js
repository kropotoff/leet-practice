 * Word Search II (Hard)
 *
 * A content filter scans a grid of characters for multiple banned words
 * simultaneously. Given an m x n board of letters and a list of words,
 * return all words that can be found in the grid. Words are formed by
 * tracing adjacent cells (horizontal/vertical), each cell used at most
 * once per word.
 *
 * Pattern: Trie + DFS backtracking on grid, with branch pruning
 *
 * @param {string[][]} board
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {string[]}
